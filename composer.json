	"description": "Hi, I'm a starter theme called <code>Underwind</code>, which is a terrible name, but I'm a combination of Underscores and Tailwind. I'm a theme meant for hacking, so don't just use me as a Parent Theme. Instead, try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. But mediocrity built at a reasonable pace is cool too. I won't judge. I grew up reading about a school bus taking children into space without any no permission slips or waivers, so yeah, I'm definitely not going to judge.",
